# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Spots is a responsive social media profile page, designed and built as part of TripleTen’s Software Engineering program.

This project displays a user profile along with a grid of image cards — mimicking the layout of a real-world photo-sharing platform. It's fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Users can:
- View a user profile with avatar and description
- Browse location-based image cards
- Interact with buttons using hover effects
- Experience a smooth layout on all screen sizes
